I'm Brad McGonigle, a full stack web developer and designer from Orlando, Florida.

When I'm not creating things on the web, I spend my time with my georgous wife Shaina. I'm an avid surfer, hockey player and all-round sports fan. I like to think I'm a good cook and recently starting smoking meats.
